Initial impressions
- The algorithm is very memory intensive

Technique exploration

Evaluation exploration

- Benchmarks
    - Benchmarked GLADE
    - 8 ground truth Grammar Oracle
    - 3 runnable program Oracle

- Accuracy
    - WHAT DOES DETERMISNISTINC AND NON-DETERMINISTIC MEAN IN THIS CONTEXT.

- Performance Analysis
    -  Since og is run on python compared to java (GLADE), it is slower
        - Does building it in C help?
    - ARVADA's 3 most costly:
        - calling the Oracle
        - creating, scoring, and sorting the bubble
        - sampling string for replacement checks

- Discussion
    - WHAT IS MAXIMAL GENERALIZATION, AND WHY DOES IT ASSUME CONTEXT FREE?
        -- Explained in the video by Caroline
    - No observed reaction to context sensitive input languages
    - There is much room for improvement with the sorting

Notes:
- In section III(A),the function MERGEALLVALID is confusing and explained very poorly.


Talk with RAHUL::
Panini paper ( static inference of grammar and parsers ) ( look at these grammars ) 
- Look at the research in the latest 5 years after ARVADA.
- What are the drawbacks of ARVADA?
- Suspicion that ARVADA is a selective study.
